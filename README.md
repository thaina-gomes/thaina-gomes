### Hi there! 😁

My name is Thaina Gomes de Araujo from Brazil (🇧🇷). I'm a student of Computer Engineering at Fedaral University of Espírito Santo. I'm currently working as a Web Developer at [Adapti Jr](https://adapti.info). 

In my free time I like to play (and watch) sports (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚) and to listen to music (🎵).

Would you like to find me?
